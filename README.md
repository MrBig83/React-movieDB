# React-movieDB

A task in five parts where I´m going to create a movie database page that presents populat movies. 
Requested function is the possibility to mark/unmark a movie as "Seen" or "Unseen". It should also be possible to sort the movies bases on IMDB-rating or popularity. 

It´ll be fun. :)
